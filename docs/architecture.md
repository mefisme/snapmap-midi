# Architecture

A contributor-orientation map of how a MIDI file becomes a playable map. For what the
tool does and every knob it exposes see [`capabilities.md`](capabilities.md); for the engine
limit that shapes the whole design see [`limits.md`](limits.md).

## The subsystems

Modules are grouped by subsystem and stacked. Each layer may use the ones below it and never
the ones above, and a test asserts exactly that.

```
   compile.py / cli.py / settings.py /      the product surface
   project.py / ui/
                  |
   audio/     locate, wwise, pitch, library installed catalog, roots, preview
                  |
   music/     song, importer, levers,       the editable song and its conversion
              timing, pipeline
              midi, gm, expression, voices  notes: pairing, timbre, expression
              analysis
                  |
   sound/     palette, events, timeline     sounds: names, event calls, scheduling
                  |
   rawmap/    codec, values, refs,          maps: bytes, entities, tables
              document, template
```

That is not tidiness for its own sake. A future non-music tool should be able to depend on
`rawmap/` as an ordinary library, and promoting it to its own distribution should be a
directory move. Someone placing sounds by hand should be able to use `sound/` with no MIDI
compiler present. Both stay true only if the layering is proven rather than assumed.

`paths.py` sits outside the stack: it imports nothing internal, so any layer may use it.

## The pipeline

A compile is a straight line. Each stage owns one module, and each hands the next explicit
values rather than a hidden audio or UI context.

```
song.mid                              (read ONCE, at import)
   |
   |  music/midi.py       pair events; preserve stable id, source pitch, velocity
   |  music/importer.py   pairs -> tracks of written notes, ids clear of what is held
   |  music/timing.py     the source clock: tempo and time-signature map
   v
Song  (tracks, notes, per-track levers)  + settings v23
   |
   |  music/levers.py     the song's stored choices -> conversion keywords
   |  music/gm.py         program -> family; channel 9 -> percussion
   |  sound/palette.py    family + source pitch -> nearest rooted sample
   v
annotated notes  (+ sound, + root evidence, + sustained?)
   |
   |  music/expression.py root-relative semitones + note/global dB
   v

   |
   |  music/voices.py     shared/isolated split, duration policy, thinning, voices
   v
scheduled notes  (+ voice and effective tail)
   |
   |  rawmap/template.py  author the blank stage the song is played in
   |  sound/events.py     pitch/gain -> start -> optional glide -> stop/release
   |  sound/timeline.py   write events onto the timeline; add the trigger switch
   v
   |  compile.py          orchestrate the above, return bytes + statistics
   v
rawmap.json
```

### `music/midi.py` — parse and pair

Reads the file with `mido` and pairs each note-on with its matching note-off, producing a
list of notes with a start and an end. An unmatched note-on is closed at the end of the
track rather than dropped: a stuck note is audible and diagnosable, a missing one is not.
Each positive note-on gets `channel:source-pitch:occurrence` identity before mute or sound
mapping, and retains velocity 1 through 127. Sound choice then annotates the note with its
immutable source pitch, root evidence, mixer state, and complete playback-expression
calculation; the imported MIDI file and load-bearing serialized field order remain unchanged.

Percussion is detected here too. MIDI reserves channel 9 for drums, where the note number
selects an instrument rather than a pitch.

Pairing and sound choice are two functions, not one. `pair_notes` answers a question about
the file and never changes its answer; `resolve_notes` answers a question about the user's
choices and re-answers it on every dropdown. `parse_notes` is still the two back to back,
which is what the command line and library callers want.

### `music/song.py` — the editable document

`Song` -> `Track` -> `Note`: what the workstation edits, and the only place note data lives
once a file has been imported. Ids are assigned when a note or a track comes into existence
and are never recomputed from position, which is what makes moving, inserting and deleting
expressible — the old `channel:pitch:occurrence` key was a position, so inserting one note
renumbered every later one. Every per-channel and per-note lever the settings document holds
has a field here, and the module round-trips to JSON for the project file.

Provenance is per track. A project may hold tracks imported from several `.mid` files, so
`Track.source_midi` says which one a lane came from and a lane drawn from nothing says None.

### `music/importer.py` — one file, once

Turns a `.mid` into tracks that can join an existing song rather than into a whole song, so
importing a second file adds its parts beside the first file's instead of replacing them.
Track ids, part identities and note ids are all minted clear of what the caller already
holds; for the first file into an empty project every one of those offsets is zero, so the
ids match what settings sidecars already on disk name.

### `music/levers.py` and `music/pipeline.py` — one conversion

`levers.py` turns a song's stored per-track choices into the keyword arguments
`compile_to_rawmap` names; `settings.py` does the same for a settings document, and a test
resolves both per part and demands they agree. `pipeline.py` is the conversion itself —
resolve, thin, cap, allocate — shared by the map export and the window's preview, which used
to be two copies of the same eight steps and therefore two policies.

### `music/gm.py` — the General MIDI tables

Two lookup tables and one set. A program number maps to a sound family; a channel-9 note
number maps to a percussion sound; and a set names which families sustain rather than decay.
These are data, not logic — the module has no behaviour worth testing beyond the tables
being well-formed, and one test that every name in them exists in the shipped palette.

### sound/palette.py — the curated pitch index

The shipped palette is the deterministic conversion vocabulary, not a claim that only 890
sounds exist in DOOM. It contains 890 event identifiers across 24 categories and records the
pitch relationships automatic MIDI conversion needs. Resolution is two-step: narrow to a
family, then pick the sound whose nominal pitch is nearest the note, preferring the same pitch
class in another octave over a nearer absolute pitch that would be out of key.

#### Reading a pitch out of a name is ambiguous

A sound spells its note at the end of its name, and b is both a note and a flat marker. For
example, play_fluteb4 can split as play_flute plus b4, which is B4, or play_flut plus eb4,
which is the wrong E-flat interpretation. The instrument stem settles it. The stem is chosen
per category as the prefix that lets the most names parse, and the note is read from what
follows it.

Matching the suffix alone previously read every wind B as a flat a tritone away and treated
play_clave1 as a pitched E from the final letter of clave. A name the curated palette knows
and gives no pitch is unpitched and is not guessed again.

The palette also derives which categories can play a pitch at all. Twelve of the 24 can.
Names such as ins_string and ins_synth look instrument-like but contain no usable pitch index,
so prefix-based classification would silently route an entire channel to nothing.

The installed full-game catalog is deliberately separate. It supplies thousands of exact
manual choices, but those events generally have no instrument family or chromatic coverage.
Automatic mapping therefore remains on the curated index. An exact assignment repeats its event
string for every MIDI note on the channel, but selecting it does not decode or analyze it. Explicit
**Analyze sound** lazily asks `audio/pitch.py` whether its decoded media has a trustworthy musical
root. Pitchable events can then follow MIDI from that measured
octave. A spectral guard rejects a candidate above the strongest lower component instead of
promoting a chime overtone to a fundamental. Tonal but root-ambiguous media, rejected speech,
noise, impacts, ambience, and variable containers keep natural playback by default. If the user
explicitly enables Follow MIDI note, those rootless events use a fixed MIDI 60/C4 operational
reference. It is never inferred from the channel's first note, range, midpoint, or median and is
not presented as acoustic evidence.

### `music/expression.py` — one pitch and loudness contract

Every parsed note carries a stable source id and its MIDI velocity. The MIDI parser keeps separate
optional absolute values for Manual and Follow MIDI modes, selects only the active one, and passes it
to the expression module. That module keeps source pitch immutable while deriving an optional
automatic fractional root-relative shift, applying the active user-facing SnapMap pitch override,
track transpose, and cents fine tune,
initializing note volume from velocity, applying an optional absolute note-volume override and
global volume, and producing final SnapMap modifiers without changing the `Note` dataclass's
serialized field order.

SnapMap pitch values are floating-point semitones clamped to -24 through 24. Velocity uses a squared
amplitude response, `40 * log10(velocity / 127)`, to initialize note volume. A per-note
override replaces that level; global dB is added afterward, and the output is clamped to -60
through 20. In Follow MIDI mode, no active override means use the derived root-relative value; in
Manual mode, no active override means zero. Switching modes selects state without mutating it. The
same pure functions feed map export, preview manifests, warnings, and inspector readouts.

### The split that defines the design

A sound's decay behavior and a note's expression requirements are independent. The compiler
therefore uses three paths:

- **Neutral decaying notes** have zero pitch and volume modifiers. They stay fully polyphonic
  on the shared Timeline entity and need neither a dedicated voice nor a note-off.
- **Expressive decaying notes** need independent pitch or gain. They receive a generic Timeline emitter
  reserved through installed-event duration, or a conservative fallback when duration metadata
  is unavailable. They decay naturally and are not explicitly stopped.
- **Sustained notes** receive a Timeline emitter plus an explicit stop or release at note end.

A shared emitter cannot safely receive per-note pitch or gain because its modifier would also
affect a neighboring note. A sustained note with no note-off can ring its entire sample and
smear into the next phrase. Those two constraints define the split.

### `music/voices.py` — preparation, allocation, and thinning

`prepare_voice_layers` is shared by compiler and preview. It applies the per-track Sustain Limit
or the song default, separates neutral and expressive one-shots, reserves expressive tails, and
builds per-track layers.
Per-track Polyphony runs first. Global Polyphony then admits at most its song-wide count across
all retained notes, before the shared/isolated split, so a large native chord on the shared
Timeline cannot evade it. Track Voices is applied before isolated notes enter one global emitter
pool. The emitters are generic `idTarget_Timeline` entities rather than
`idSnapMapGameEntity_Speaker`: the latter intercepts sound starts but did not accept the tested
Timeline pitch path. Track Voices 1 preserves a local monophonic lane, and the optional per-track
glide duration follows that lane even when the global allocator reuses a different physical
emitter. This keeps the map's dedicated-emitter count inside Global Voices while retaining
per-track control over density and voice use.
Voice stealing and sustain limiting remain separate: stealing shortens an older note only when a
new attack needs its occupied lane, while a Sustain Limit intentionally caps written held-note
duration whether or not the voice pool is under pressure.
Global Polyphony is admission control rather than stealing: notes already held keep their length,
and only capacity available at a new onset is filled. It uses written MIDI ends, not decaying
sample tails, so a one-note-at-a-time melody cannot be emptied by a long recording tail.

The compiler authors the compact, single-master form and currently retains it for every export.
`ENABLE_TIMELINE_SHARDING` is deliberately false pending contributor approval and in-game fanout
acceptance. The dormant path can activate voice Timelines as independent schedule shards and split
larger schedules only between timestamps, but production does not call it. `timeline_bytes` and
`timeline_unsharded_bytes` therefore both describe the master while the feature is disabled, and a
master over `TIMELINE_SERIALIZE_BUDGET` produces an editor-access warning.

MIDI composition duration is independent of those voice tails. `_timing_manifest` retains the
exact source End-of-Track tick/time and derives a workstation boundary at the end of the current
final measure. The latter gives the piano roll its trailing rest without modifying a `Note.end`.
On natural transport completion, JavaScript stops its scheduling clock but does not call
`stop()` on already-started Web Audio sources. Finite one-shots and sustained release ramps
therefore finish exactly as their SnapMap counterparts do. Explicit pause, seek, replay, or state
changes still stop the old sources immediately.

Thinning drops notes when too many would be live at once. It is the mechanism behind
`max_poly` and the family caps; see [`limits.md`](limits.md) for why a dense arrangement
needs it.

### `sound/events.py` — event construction

Builds the engine's event calls: start a sound, set pitch with `fadePitch`, set gain with
`fadeSound`, and stop or release a sustained sound. Immediate pitch and gain modifiers serialize
before their same-time sound start; a glide starts from the prior track-local pitch and schedules
its target one millisecond after the attack for the requested duration. Nothing here knows about
MIDI; it takes resolved values and times and emits the raw event-call structure.

### `sound/timeline.py` — the authoring API

Writes events onto a timeline entity and adds the switch that triggers it. This is the
reusable layer: `author_sound_timeline` takes a list of `(sound, milliseconds)` pairs and
returns finished map bytes. It keeps direct sound-map authoring available without coupling
that job to MIDI parsing or the desktop UI.

`find_timeline` used to raise when a document had no timeline, with a message telling the
caller to go and find a baseline map containing one. It now authors one, and is called
`ensure_timeline` because it no longer only finds — `SnapMapDocument.find_timeline` keeps
that name for the pure query that returns `None`.

### `compile.py` — orchestration

Two doors onto one core. `compile_song` takes an open song plus the levers to convert it
with; `compile_to_rawmap` takes a file path and keyword levers, imports the file into a
transient song, and calls that core. The second one's signature and bytes are contract-tested
— `cli.py` splats its flags straight into it — so the song model sits underneath the command
line rather than in front of it.

Runs the stages above in order and returns `(bytes, statistics)`. The statistics dictionary
is not decoration: the byte gates assert on it, so a byte difference reports *what* changed
rather than only *that* something did.

The summary distinguishes `shared_one_shots`, `expressive_one_shots`, and total
`expressive_notes`, and reports pitch/volume adjustment and clamp counts from parsing.
`long_sustains` counts notes held past a second and `peak_voices` is the largest allocation
any channel layer reached. Event count alone is not a pressure metric: neutral one-shots hold no
dedicated speaker, while expressive one-shots reserve one for their measured or fallback tail.

### `settings.py` — one document, two surfaces

The window's whole state as a single JSON document, validated here and turned into keyword
arguments for `compile_to_rawmap`. Both surfaces read it — the window through its session,
the command line through `--settings` — so one document drives either of them and produces
the same bytes. A test compiles a default document and a bare `compile_to_rawmap` call and
compares the two.

It sits at the surface rather than under it because it validates against `sound/palette.py`
and hands arguments to `compile.py`, which are both at or above the layer it would otherwise
occupy. Its defaults mirror `compile_to_rawmap`'s own, named rather than imported, and the
byte gate is what keeps the two from drifting.

Exact palette names are accepted directly. Other channel sound assignments must match the
measured Play-event alphabet and maximum length, but validation does not require the current
game install. That keeps sidecars loadable after DOOM moves and permits an explicit mod event;
the UI itself offers the Play events declared by the installed retail catalog.

Settings version 2 added optional `pitch_follow`, `root_midi`, `root_confidence`, and
`root_source` fields to exact channel choices, plus a sparse top-level `notes` mapping.
Version 6 requires `root_midi` to identify the sound's actual natural note. Legacy relative and
octave-fitted references are disabled during migration because they could transpose absolute pitch.
A version-7 `pitch_follow_preference` separates the user's channel choice from the acoustic profile
of whichever exact sound is currently assigned. Current selection behavior resets that preference
to off for a newly chosen exact sound, because analysis and tuning are opt-in; mute/solo state and
every source-note override remain preserved.
Version 8 adds the neutral C4 opt-in reference and absolute `pitch_semitones` note edits. Version 9
defines that field as the preserved Manual value and adds an optional `follow_pitch_semitones`
value for user adjustments made while automatic following is active.
A note key is `channel:source-pitch:occurrence`, which stays stable across retimbre, mute,
solo, and root changes. Each entry may hold both decimal pitch values (-24 through 24) and
`volume_db` (-60 through 20), both absolute engine values. Explicit zero is retained. Legacy
sidecars may retain a relative `pitch_offset` until that note is edited.

Settings version 3 adds integral `tuning.master_volume_db` (-60 through 20). Version 4 adds
`soloed` and renames legacy note `transpose` to `pitch_offset`. Version 5 makes note
`volume_db` absolute; version 1 through 4 relative values migrate to a compatibility-only
`volume_trim_db` field and retain their prior playback until edited. Version 6 removes silent
octave fitting from exact-sound pitch references. Version 7 deep-merges sparse note patches and
serializes browser-side settings writes, so concurrent pitch, volume, and sound changes cannot
replace one another. Version 8 makes the visible note Pitch value absolute while preserving legacy
relative offsets. Version 9 makes pitch-mode toggles reversible by preserving Manual and Follow MIDI
adjustments independently; a version-8 value becomes the Manual state. Version 13 adds preserved
detector evidence, per-track transpose/fine-tune fields, and fractional Timeline pitch export.
Decoded audio never persists.

Validation is load-bearing rather than defensive: this file is meant to be hand-edited, and
every mistake a hand edit makes here is a quiet one. See
[`ui.md`](ui.md#the-settings-sidecar).

### audio/ — installed catalog and optional local preview

This layer supplies local sound metadata, root analysis, and preview bytes to Web Audio;
rawmap authoring still does not embed or copy audio. `locate.py` finds a usable DOOM install
from the explicit override or Steam records. `wwise.py` indexes the language-neutral retail
banks plus one localization, resolves event hashes through HIRC to every reachable media leaf,
and decodes the measured Wwise IMA ADPCM format without an external codec. A source signature
covers all leaf IDs so cache entries invalidate when an event's media topology changes.

HIRC stores hashes rather than names, so it cannot enumerate a sound browser. The generated
soundbanksinfo.events file supplies event strings, Wwise paths, buses, environments, numeric
IDs, and compact duration data. The larger soundbanksinfo.xml overlay distinguishes Mixed
duration events from ordinary one-shots. DoomSounds joins the two metadata sources and keeps
every Play event string while separately recording whether it resolves to standalone local
media. The reference retail installation contains 7,589 Play events across 7,649 catalog
records; 7,353 support local decoding.

`library.py` exposes that full catalog lazily, overlays the small curated label set, and falls
back to the shipped 890-name palette when installed metadata is absent. Curated palette pitches
are authoritative. For an arbitrary exact event, `pitch.py` analyzes bounded windows from all
available leaves with a conservative YIN-style estimator. Silence, weak or unstable periodicity,
containers whose leaves disagree, and candidates contradicted by lower dominant spectral energy
are rejected rather than assigned a guessed root.

An ambiguous periodic result says the event is tonal but its fundamental cannot be trusted.
Python leaves such an event at natural playback by default. Channel settings can explicitly rerun
analysis and supply a manual natural note while preserving the raw detection for comparison.
Follow MIDI note remains an explicit opt-in using the non-acoustic neutral C4 reference. A trusted
root keeps the measured octave. Notes outside SnapMap's -24 through 24 range expose ordinary
clamp diagnostics instead of silently transposing the channel to reduce overflow.

Accepted and rejected profiles are cached as small numeric JSON records keyed by install,
event, complete media signature, and analysis version. The cache contains root, confidence,
source, and rejection state only—never PCM or game content. Direct audition and song preview
still decode only requested sounds. Engine-only composite events remain exportable, have a
disabled audition control, and are skipped with a warning if used in song preview. The explicit
extract command remains a 890-sound, versioned offline audio cache; expanding it to every event
would defeat the in-place architecture.

The decoder remains rooted at the retail base soundbank directory and never recursively merges
runtime-injected mod banks, preventing a colliding mod event or media ID from overriding stock
content. Every decoded byte is derived on the user's machine, preview failure cannot stop the
editor or change a compile, and synthetic tests cover parser, provider, localization, fallback,
pitch acceptance/rejection, and mod isolation without redistributing game data.

### `ui/` — the MIDI workstation

A pywebview window over the library. `app.py` opens it and is the only module
that imports pywebview at all — inside a function, so importing the package still works on a
machine that will never open a window. `session.py` holds the open SONG, the settings
document, analysis, statistics, and resolved preview manifest behind a lock, because bridge
calls arrive on separate threads. The song is imported once and held; a settings patch is
projected onto its tracks and notes rather than sending the compiler back to the file.
`history.py` is the session-only undo stack — a linear list of do/undo pairs with a cursor,
which structural edits push onto. `project.py`, one layer down at the surface, is the only
module that sees both a song and a settings document: it resolves a document's wildcard
channel entries onto the tracks they covered, writes the reverse projection when a saved
project is opened, and reads and writes the `.smsong.json` project file. Saving a project
never touches the `.mid`.
`api.py` is the class pywebview exposes to Javascript; every method returns
`{"ok": true, ...}` or `{"ok": false, "error": "..."}` and none of them raises, because an
exception crossing that boundary reaches Javascript as an opaque `Error` with nothing worth
showing. `chrome.py` removes the drawn Windows caption while retaining the native resize,
snap, taskbar and system-menu behaviour. `web/` is hand-written HTML, CSS and Javascript —
no framework, no bundler — and its shared tokens and shell primitives are the exact Snapmap
Plus design contract. Its purpose-trimmed Lucide symbols are embedded as a local SVG sprite; the full icon library
and any runtime dependency stay out of the package, while the upstream license ships beside
the web assets.

Nothing is served and nothing listens. The markup is loaded from the filesystem through a
`file:///` URI, so the window has no address and no port;
`test_product_has_no_network_client` still passes over the whole package.

**The division of labour is the design.** Python decides every conversion fact: sound and
root, immutable source pitch, automatic and offset pitch, velocity-derived initial note volume,
absolute note overrides, global volume, mute/solo inclusion, clamp state, sustain behavior,
duration caps, polyphony, speaker
voice, reuse cutoff, and requested audio samples. Compiler and preview call the same preparation,
and the same versioned settings document feeds the preview manifest and `compile_to_rawmap`.

Javascript owns presentation and transport: it virtualizes the full 0-127 pitch range and song
duration behind native scrollbars, draws synchronized pitch and measure rulers, converts MIDI
ticks through the supplied tempo map, moves and auto-follows the single playhead against Web
Audio's output timestamp rather than its ahead-of-output scheduling clock, and schedules
decoded buffers with a rolling look-ahead. It applies the manifest's final pitch as
`playbackRate = 2 ** (pitch_modifier / 12)` and final loudness as
`gain = 10 ** (volume_db / 20)`; it does not repeat root, velocity, global-volume, or clamp
logic. Because Wwise voice pitch is resampling rather than independent time stretching, browser
media offsets and Python's one-shot voice reservations also use the finalized playback rate.
The manifest supplies both the exact source boundary and a final-measure workstation boundary;
neither is compiled as a fake note or no-op Timeline event because silence requires no event.
Settings
changes cross the bridge and return a rebuilt manifest.

Rendering is split by update frequency. The base canvas holds pitch rows, timing lines, notes,
labels, and channel emphasis; separate pointer-transparent canvases hold the moving playhead and
hover/selection feedback. A playback animation therefore clears and paints only the overlays
until the viewport actually changes. Note glow is pointer-only and remains available while
playing; the playhead never starts an all-events active-note scan. Indexed hit testing opens the
Note expression inspector for a note, while empty surface input keeps the existing seek path.
Selection uses an outline and does not become a playback animation.

Channel-row selection opens a separate Channel settings inspector while retaining the existing
display-only focus filter. For exact sounds, that inspector exposes `pitch_follow`, analyzer
refresh and evidence, a manual root, track transpose, cents fine tune, and effective pitch. Note
expression consumes the resolved basis as read-only context. Its integer slider reads the active
whole-semitone value and writes `pitch_semitones` in Manual mode or `follow_pitch_semitones` in Follow
MIDI mode. Neither write removes the other field. It also writes the sparse per-note volume override.
The two inspectors are mutually exclusive, so control scope is visible in the surface hierarchy.

The manifest's `events` list schedules audible converted audio. Its `display_events` list
retains mapped notes excluded by mute, solo, or polyphony so the roll can remain truthful.
Display events are normalized once into 128 pitch buckets sorted by start time. Each bucket
also stores prefix maximum end times, allowing two binary searches to reject events outside the
visible time range before geometry is built. At 100% whole-song overview, the full static roll is
rasterized once when its high-DPI allocation fits a fixed 16-million-pixel budget; vertical wheel
scrolling then blits the visible crop. At inspection zoom, only indexed events overlapping the
visible pitches and time range are drawn. Tiny overview notes are batched as simple paths, while
rounded blocks, outlines, and labels are reserved for geometry large enough to show them.

Theme values, normalized tempo changes, timing-line geometry, and unchanged rulers are cached.
Tempo lookup is binary, grid density is bounded by viewport pixels instead of a fixed thousands-
of-ticks loop, and canvas backing density is capped at 2x. Current-time text updates at its visible
tenth-second precision and the native scrubber at roughly 30 Hz. Scroll and pointer requests are
still coalesced through one pending animation frame. The disabled horizontal-scrollbar cover
retains pointer interception for click and drag, while its non-passive wheel handler forwards
vertical deltas to the pitch viewport. Playback follows in sections: the line sweeps through the
passage and advances the viewport only after crossing its leading threshold, avoiding a static
canvas repaint on every audio frame.

Zoom captures the playhead's viewport coordinate before resizing and restores that coordinate
against the new time scale. The draggable pane separator stores only the preferred channel
width in local browser storage, clamps it against dynamic channel/roll minimums, and resizes the
high-DPI canvases on the next animation frame. Grid, meter, zoom, pane width, hover, channel
focus, and which channel/note inspector is open are view state. Global volume, per-note pitch/volume
mode values, exact-channel root choices, mute, and multi-solo are conversion state and go through
the validated settings bridge.

JavaScript names no palette family or game event in source. The small startup catalog comes
from the curated palette; the full installed event catalog crosses a separate lazy bridge only
when the modal opens. Results are folder-indexed and paginated so thousands of events do not
become thousands of live DOM controls.

## The authoring core

`src/snapmap_midi/rawmap/` is a general SnapMap document library. It knows nothing about
music.

| Module | Responsibility |
|---|---|
| `codec.py` | serialize and deserialize the map format |
| `values.py` | the `Vec3`, `Mat2D`, `Mat3`, `Pointer` value builders |
| `refs.py` | reference-slot authoring and the unbound sentinels |
| `document.py` | `SnapMapDocument` — entities, speakers, timelines, connections, cloning |
| `template.py` | the blank map authored from nothing, and the timeline entity |
| `palette_refs.py` | the reference-slot counts for every entity kind this tool authors |

### The blank stage

`template.py` authors a complete, loadable map containing nothing but somewhere to stand.

| Piece | id | Why it is there |
|---|---|---|
| two portal caps | 56, 57 | a module's portals must be joined or capped; uncapped, the map is rejected |
| player start | 61 | somewhere to spawn, and the anchor the switch is placed next to |
| timeline | 62 | the scheduler the song is written onto |

The ids are fixed rather than allocated because `doorsAndCaps` refers to the caps by id, and
because keeping them where an engine-saved map puts them keeps the document comparable to
one.

It also carries **sixteen persistent integers** in its `variables` block. Those are not user
content that a fresh map legitimately has none of: every engine-saved map to hand carries
exactly sixteen, byte-identical, with the same default names and bounds, while every other
variable kind varies from map to map. That makes them part of the format. A stage authored
without them matched no engine-produced sample.

`allocCount` is emitted as zeros. Which slot counts which kind is **not** established — a
saved map with eighteen booleans carries the eighteen at index 2, not where the key order
would suggest — so the template claims nothing beyond "no names have been handed out", which
is true of a map with no user variables in it.

Building a map from nothing was previously called impractical, on the grounds that the
editor generates cap entities and populates the reference tables when it SAVES and does not
reconstruct them when it LOADS. That is still true. It is an argument for authoring those
tables explicitly, which is what this module does, not for demanding a saved map.

### Reference slots, and why they are injected

The engine validates every entity's reference-bucket sizes against the counts recorded for
its inherit path. A mismatch is not a soft failure — the map is rejected at load.

`SnapMapDocument` takes its table as a constructor argument rather than baking one in, and
an unknown inherit raises `UnknownInheritError` instead of defaulting to zero slots. A
silent zero authors a map the engine refuses to open, with nothing in the tool's output to
say why.

`palette_refs.py` documents which of its pairs are observed in engine-saved maps and which
are inference. Every pair except the switch is observed.

## Proof

The from-scratch path is not only tested; it has been run against the game. A compiled map
was loaded into the live editor with all seven authored entities present at their assigned
ids — including the timeline at 62 — and playtested through the editor → play → exit cycle
without a crash.

Three byte gates guard the output. See [`limits.md`](limits.md#the-byte-gate-honesty-rule).
