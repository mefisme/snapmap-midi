"""A blank, loadable map document authored from nothing.

Authoring used to start from a saved map the user supplied, for two stated
reasons. Both are addressed here.

The first was structural: the editor generates cap entities and populates the
reference tables when it SAVES and does not reconstruct them when it LOADS, so
a document missing them is rejected. That is still true — which is why this
module authors them explicitly rather than omitting them.

The second was the timeline. `idTarget_Timeline` is not placeable from the
stock entity palette, so the conclusion drawn at the time was that a timeline
had to be inherited from an existing map. That conflated two different things:
making the engine SPAWN a timeline at runtime, which really is not possible
from outside, and DESCRIBING one in a saved map, which is just schema. A
timeline in a saved map is an ordinary entity whose class is
`idTarget_Timeline` and whose inherit is the stock `snapmaps/unknown`, and its
reference-slot pair is (0, 0) — the cheapest entry in the whole table.

Every constant below is schema: engine class names, stock declaration paths,
and structural shapes. No game content is reproduced here.

The geometry is one blank room module with its two portals capped. That is the
smallest thing that is still a real, walkable map, and it is deliberately
boring: this is a stage for a song, not a level.
