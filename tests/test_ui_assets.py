"""What the window's Javascript assumes about Python, checked as text.

There is no browser engine in this suite and there is not going to be one. The
whole shape of this feature exists to avoid needing one: Python owns every
decision the window shows, including the ruler's geometry, so what is left
untestable is markup and nothing else.

That split leaves exactly one seam, and this file is the only thing standing on
it. `app.js` names Python methods and reads Python dictionary keys, and it names
them as strings. A string that stopped naming anything does not raise here, or
in `tests/test_ui_api.py`, or anywhere else in this suite -- it fails in a
window, at a click, in front of somebody who has no console to read it in. The
Open button simply stops working.

So this reads the three assets as text and asserts against them, the way
snapmap-plus checks its own webview (`tests/theme_contract_test.c`): source-text
assertions, no browser, no DOM. It is a crude instrument. It is also the only
one that can see this class of failure at all.
