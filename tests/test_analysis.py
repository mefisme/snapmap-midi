"""Reading a MIDI file as channels, and placing those channels on a ruler.

The compiler answers "what should this play". This module answers "what is in
here", which is a different question and has to be asked before the first one
collapses a program number into a family. These tests are about the answers
being usable: names a person recognises, counts rather than extremes, and
geometry that a browser only has to position.

The geometry lives in Python precisely so it can be tested. An axis that clips
the one family the automatic mapping can never choose, a disjoint range drawn
as a slightly worse version of overhang, a drum channel plotted on a pitch axis
-- every one of those is caught here and by nothing in a stylesheet.
