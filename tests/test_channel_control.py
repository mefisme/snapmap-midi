"""Per-channel mute, per-drum-key remap, and the statistics the engine limit justifies.

Three separate claims live here, and they fail in different ways:

  - A muted channel contributes nothing, and is not reported as a problem. A
    note the user silenced on purpose showing up in `dropped` turns the one
    number that means "the palette had no sound for this" into noise.
  - A per-key drum choice is the user's and is final. `drum_overrides` is keyed
    by resolved shader and post-processes what the TABLE picked, so applying it
    on top of a per-key override silently replaces a sound just chosen.
  - The statistics name what `docs/limits.md` names. Total event count is
    not a density measure; shared neutral one-shots and isolated expressive
    notes are reported separately from peak per-channel voice use.

The byte gate at the end is the fourth claim: both levers are inert when empty.
