"""The Javascript bridge, exercised with no browser engine anywhere near it.

Three claims, and every test here is one of them.

The first is that the bridge answers. pywebview resolves each call as a
promise, and an exception raised on the Python side arrives in Javascript as an
opaque Error with nothing worth showing someone who is looking at a window
rather than a console. So a missing file, a hand-written family that does not
exist, and a patch that is not a mapping at all are all payloads here rather
than tracebacks.

The second is that the answers are batched the way the first frame needs them.
`startup` carries settings, analysis, catalog, rulers and statistics together;
anything that can change the analysis carries the analysis back, because a
window told only about settings would go on drawing the last song's drum keys.

The third is the sidecar, which is the only reason a choice made in the window
outlives the window. Export writes it beside the song, opening the song again
applies it, and a sidecar that has been hand-edited into nonsense costs its
settings and not the song.

Nothing in this file imports pywebview and nothing skips without it. The file
dialogs answer before they reach `import webview`, and the two tests that need
a real dialog install a stand-in through `sys.modules` -- the same trick
`tests/test_cli.py` uses to prove the opposite branch.

Every test that exports names its own output folder under `tmp_path` and
compiles a COPY of the fixture. Export writes two files, `rawmap.json` into the
output folder and the settings sidecar beside the song, and a test that let
either of those default would write into the loader's own folder -- destroying
whatever map the person running the suite had loaded -- or leave a settings
file behind in `tests/fixtures/`.
