"""Where the finished map goes, and optional overrides for what goes into it.

## Where the map goes

The map loader reads exactly one file: `rawmap.json`, in its own data folder
under the user's local application data. Not a directory it scans, not a name
it is told -- one hardcoded path. A map written anywhere else, or under any
other name, cannot be loaded without being renamed and moved first.

So that is the default destination, and the filename is not configurable.
Choosing a name that cannot work was the old behaviour and it produced files
that looked finished and were not.

## Optional overrides

Nothing here is required any more, and that is the point. snapmap-midi used to
refuse to run until you found two files inside an installed copy of the game
and configured paths to them: a speaker declaration, and a saved map that
happened to contain a timeline entity. Both are gone. The sound palette ships
with the package, and the map is authored from nothing.

What is left are genuine overrides, for people doing something unusual:

    palette_decl    a speaker declaration to read INSTEAD of the shipped
                    palette, for a game version whose sounds differ
    baseline_map    a saved map to add the song to, instead of staging it in
                    a freshly authored blank room
    groove_fixture  the byte-identical regression artifact for the timeline
                    authoring API; one test, and it is not distributed
    doom_install    the game directory to read audio out of, for a copy the
                    Steam search cannot reach -- a portable install, a second
                    machine's drive, a manually placed copy

Configuration is a JSON object mapping logical name to path, supplied either
inline or as a file:

    SNAPMAP_MIDI_PATHS=/path/to/snapmap-midi-paths.json
    SNAPMAP_MIDI_PATHS={"baseline_map": "..."}

Every resolver returns None when the input has not been configured, which is
the ordinary case rather than an error state.
