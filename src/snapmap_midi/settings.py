"""One document holding every choice a compile makes, in a form that survives.

The window changes one thing at a time -- a family here, a mute there -- and
each change has to become a complete set of compiler arguments again. Sending
only the changed field would let the compiler's own defaults stand in for
everything already chosen, so what is kept is the whole document and what is
handed to `compile_to_rawmap` is the whole document. `merge` is how a single
change gets in without disturbing the rest.

It is stored as JSON beside the song, because it is the only record of an
afternoon's tuning and someone will open it in an editor. That makes validation
load-bearing rather than defensive: a hand edit is an ordinary way for this file
to change, and the mistakes a hand edit makes are quiet ones. An unpitched
family compiles to silence with no error anywhere. A lever name that no longer
exists reads as applied and does nothing. `{"channels": {"0": "ins_piano"}}` is
the shape everyone writes first. Each of those is refused here, by name, rather
than surviving into a map that loads and plays the wrong thing.

The defaults are the compiler's own, to the byte. The window opens on this
document before anyone has touched a control, so a default that disagrees with
`compile_to_rawmap` would mean exporting from the window and typing the command
produce different maps for a lever nobody set. `tests/test_settings.py` compiles
both and compares the bytes.

`max_events` is deliberately absent. `compile.py` implements it as
`decaying_events[:max_events]`, which truncates the one-shot list in TIME order
-- the drums stop partway through the song and stay stopped. Behind a control
that reads as a density limit, that is a trap; it stays a command-line flag.

    Version 23 adds a song-wide `playback_speed` multiplier. No stored value
    changes: the key is absent on every migrated document, and absent means
    the compiler's own default of 1.0 applies, which is the tempo the file
    already compiled at.

    Version 16 adds a strict song-wide audible-note limit. Older documents use
    the new default of 32 notes.

    Version 15 adds an optional per-track sustain-duration override. Missing
    values continue to use the song's default sustain limit, which is off in a
    new document.

    Version 18 adds an optional per-track note-off release. Version 17
    sidecars inherit the 0.1-second song default.

    Version 17 adds a neutral-by-default per-track volume offset. Version 16
    sidecars therefore migrate without needing a new field.

    Version 14 adds an optional per-track glide duration for exact sounds.
    Version 13 preserves fractional pitch through Timeline export and adds
    per-track semitone transpose, cents fine tune, and the raw detected root.
    Older sidecars default those controls to zero.

    Version 12 makes Global Voices a genuine song-wide pool while retaining
    the optional per-track `voices` cap. Older sidecars already spell the
    track setting that way, so migration preserves it.

    Version 9 separates each note's preserved manual pitch from its optional
    Follow MIDI override. Version-8 pitch_semitones values become the manual
    state; when Follow MIDI is active and no mode-specific override exists,
    the displayed and exported value is derived automatically.


    Version 8 lets any exact sound opt into MIDI following from a stable C4
    reference and stores user-facing note pitch as an absolute SnapMap value.
    Existing relative pitch offsets remain valid and keep their original
    playback behavior.

    Version 22 adds a per-track octave fold. No stored value changes: the key
    is absent on every migrated document, and absent means the fold is decided
    automatically from how far the track's notes sit from its reference. A
    track already corrected by hand with transpose measures as in range and is
    therefore not moved again.

    Version 7 separates the user's channel-wide Follow MIDI note preference
    from the effective pitch plan of one selected sound. A version-6 choice is
    retained as that preference so choosing another sound cannot reverse it.

    Version 6 removes two pitch references that could preserve intervals while
    shifting absolute playback by an octave. A legacy channel-centered
    relative reference returns to natural playback. An enabled octave-fitted
    detection is disabled and marked for acoustic re-analysis by the UI; this
    also makes direct command-line compilation safe when game media is absent.

    Version 5 makes a note's volume_db its absolute pre-master level.
    Versions 1 through 4 used the same name for a relative velocity trim, so
    migration gives that value an explicit legacy name. The expression engine
    continues to honor it exactly, and the UI replaces it with an absolute
    value when the user next edits that note.

    Version 4 separates the written MIDI note from a playback-only pitch
    offset. Versions 2 and 3 called the same integer ``transpose``. Renaming
    that sparse user value preserves its intent while allowing
    the piano roll and curated sample selection to stay faithful to the MIDI.
    Version 1 had no note-expression section.

    because the window sends what changed and nothing else. "Mute channel 1"
    arrives as `{"channels": {"1": {"muted": true}}}` and must not take channel
    1's instrument with it; changing one note's pitch must not replace another
    note's volume; capping the sustain must not reset the release. A null note
    entry removes that note override, and a null note field removes only that
    field. Nulls are patch operations and never survive into a saved document.

    `drum_keys` and `family_caps` replace wholesale: the caller sends the
    complete map, and an entry absent from it is gone. They are values rather
    than records -- a drum key's setting IS its sound, and a cap IS its number,
    so there is no second field for a deep merge to preserve. That asymmetry is
    the only thing that makes removal expressible. Validation demands a real
    sound name, so `null` cannot mean "put this key back to the table's
    answer", and under a deep merge nothing else could either: every patch
    would only ever add, and a key given a sound by mistake could never be
    taken back. `family_caps` gets this for free by sitting inside `tuning`,
    where the merge is per lever and a lever's value replaces the old one.
