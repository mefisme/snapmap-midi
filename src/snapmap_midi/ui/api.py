"""The Javascript surface: one object whose every method answers.

pywebview hands this object to the window as `window.pywebview.api` and resolves
each call as a promise. An exception raised in here does not arrive in
Javascript as this exception -- it arrives as an opaque Error carrying nothing
worth showing to someone who is looking at a window rather than a console. So
every method catches `Exception` and returns `{"ok": False, "error": ...}`, and
the failure becomes a sentence the window can put in a toast instead of a
rejected promise it can only apologise for.

Nothing here decides how a map is built. `Session` owns that state and every
rule about it; this turns its answers into payloads, resolves local preview
samples through installed soundbanks or the compatibility cache, and turns
exceptions into sentences.
Keeping that split is what lets the whole bridge be tested with no browser
engine present, and the file dialogs are careful to preserve it: they answer
None before they reach `import webview`, so `tests/test_ui_api.py` runs on a
machine that has never had pywebview installed rather than skipping.

Two things are batched deliberately, and both are about the frame the window
draws rather than about speed. `startup` answers with settings, analysis,
catalog, rulers, statistics, audio readiness and window-frame state together,
because separate promises resolving in separate orders paint partial frames.
And every answer that can change the analysis carries
the analysis with it: the drums switch decides which channel is a kit, and
opening a song changes which drum keys exist at all, so a window left to notice
either for itself is a window showing the last song's keys.

The settings sidecar is written here rather than in `Session`, because it is a
workstation persistence policy and not part of compilation. Every successful
window edit autosaves the complete validated document, and Export writes it
again beside the map. The command line writes maps and never a settings file.
