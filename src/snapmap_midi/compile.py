"""Orchestration: a MIDI file becomes a playable map.

Scheduling follows expression and decay independently:

  - Neutral decaying notes layer polyphonically on the shared Timeline entity.
  - Decaying notes with pitch or gain use isolated, duration-reserved Timeline emitters
    and are left to fade on their own.
  - Sustained notes use isolated Timeline emitters plus explicit stops or releases.

Voice preparation is shared with browser preview. Per-track voice caps keep an
instrument from monopolising the song, then a global pool enforces the map's
total emitter budget. Density controls reduce exposure to the engine's
emitter-recycling limit; per-note pitch and volume controls describe expression
and do not change that limit.

#: The largest timeline the SnapMap editor can OPEN, in serialized bytes.

#: count, so a timeline past that buffer comes back as a plain failure: the
#: editor says it cannot open the timeline and nothing says why. The map still
#: LOADS and the music still PLAYS -- only editing is lost -- which is what made
#: this so hard to place.

#: and our compact JSON running a few percent fatter than what it writes. The
#: budget is set at one MiB rather than at the measured line: it is below every
#: size proven to open, it is the round number the evidence points at, and it
#: leaves ~32 KB for the difference between their serializer and ours.

#: Raising a buffer on the READING side cannot help. That was tried first --
